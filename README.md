## 📌 Project Overview

This project brings together:

**SHORT SUMMARY: I built my own compiler, that compiles programs written in my own language (BroLang), into bytecode that runs on my own virtual CPU, which executes using my own virtual machine — all from scratch in C++.**

No libraries. No frameworks. Just raw logic, control, and architecture.

- 🧾 A **full compiler** for a custom toy language: **BroLang**
- 🧠 A **custom virtual machine** (RohitVM) to execute compiled code
- ⚙️ A **16-bit Virtual CPU** with registers, RAM, and an instruction set

 Everything — from the lexer to the VM — is handcrafted in **modern C++**, with no compiler frameworks or dependencies.

## 💡 Language: BroLang

A beginner-friendly language with C-like vibes and meme syntax:

```bro
letbro a = 10;
letbro b = 3;
printbro(a + b);

letbro a = 10;
letbro b = 3;
printbro(a / b);   

letbro a = 10;
letbro b = 3;
printbro(a - b);

letbro a = 10;
letbro b = 3;
printbro(a * b);

ifbro (a > b) {
    printbro(999);
} elsebro {
    printbro(111);
}

ifbro (a < b) {
    printbro(222);
} elsebro {
    printbro(888); 
}

ifbro (a == b) {
    printbro(333);
} elsebro {
    printbro(777);  
}

letbro counter = 0;
whilebro (counter < 3) {
    printbro(counter);   
    letbro counter = counter + 1;
}

```

# 🧱 Compiler Architecture
The BroLang Compiler is a multi-phase pipeline:
| Phase        | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Lexer**    | Converts source into tokens          |
| **Parser**   | Builds AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)    |
| **Codegen**  | Converts AST to VM instructions      |
| **Emitter**  | Writes instructions to a `.cpp` file |
| **Executor** | Runs code on the custom VM           |

# Output:
The compiler outputs C++ bytecode instructions that run on RohitVM.

---

# 🧠 RohitVM – Virtual Machine
  A stack-based virtual machine that executes bytecode generated by the compiler.

# 🧩 VM Highlights
-Executes compiled programs from BroLang
-Stack-based architecture (PUSH/POP logic)
-Built-in print, memory access, halt, arithmetic
-No use of system VM libraries — 100% custom

# 🗂️ Registers
AX, BX, CX, DX — General purpose
SP — Stack Pointer
PC — Program Counter (internally tracked)

# ⚙️ 16-bit Virtual CPU
The virtual CPU that powers RohitVM.

**Specs:**
RAM: 65 KB

Instruction Set: Over 30+ instructions
MOV, PUSH, POP, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, PRN, HLT, STL, STG, etc.

Stack Operations supported
Custom memory operations (zeroing, copying, hex dump)
